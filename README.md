# Minecraft Dice!
That's it, I added dice in Minecraft. You can place it and it'll have a random side upwards, that's the number you're looking for. Now you can use it to play games in a very analog way or use a comparator to see the result as a redstone signal. It can also be placed by dispensers and broke down with pistons, so you have a new and easy randomizer at your hands. There's also the Fatal and Nihilo Dice, that deals infinite damage if you roll an 1.

## How do I Do It Myself a Die?
Simple, since the first dice were made using bones, that's the material of choice here too!<br>
You'll need to put Bone Blocks in the crafting grid as the 6 dots of the dice plus the single dot from the opposite side to be able to craft lucky number 7 dice. Or you can just put the Bone Block in the Stone Cutter to get snake eye die from one block.<br>
The Fatal Die is a shapeless recipe from a D6 and a Wither Skeleton Skull, the Nihilo one uses End Stone instead.

    Yes, it looks like an "H" or a Ladder recipe

### That's really all of it?
Maybe, maybe not. I plan to add numbered and runic versions of them and even sets of non-transitive dice, for all your non-transitive dice needs. Also, more kinds of Fatal die, maybe one for each damage type? Maybe a way to duel with them as well.

### D6 only?
Well, I really don't know how I would make other shapes of dice in Minecraft, and anything past D15 would be strange to interact with comparators
